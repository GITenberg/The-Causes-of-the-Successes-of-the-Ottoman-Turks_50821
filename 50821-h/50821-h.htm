<p class="center f12">THE CAUSES OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE
OTTOMAN TURKS.<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the fall of the Seljukian dynasty in Asia Minor,
a vast number of Turks, scattered over the fertile
tracts of Western Asia, were left without any organized
government. The Emirs of the Seljouks in their different
districts tried to set up separate kingdoms for
themselves, but their power was successfully exercised
only in making depredations upon each other. For
some time they were under the sway of the Khans of
Persia, but the decline of the Mogul Empire after the
death of Cazan, freed them from this control<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>. During
this time of general anarchy, a clan of Oghouz
Turks, under Ertogruhl, settled in the dominions of
Alaeddin, the chief of Iconium. These Turks were
of the same family as the Huns and Avars, and the
other Barbarian hordes, whose invasions had continually
devastated Europe for nearly ten centuries<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>; nor
had the energy and restless activity of their race yet
begun to fail. They were all united by the affinity
of race, as well as by their language, and by the common
bond of the Sunnite creed. In return for Ertogruhl&#8217;s
services in war Alaeddin gave him a grant of
territory in the highlands of Phrygia. The warlike
spirit of Ertogruhl&#8217;s son Othman, raised him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
rank of an independent chieftain, and he soon made
himself master of strong positions on the borders of
the Greek Empire. With ill-judged parsimony, the
Emperor Michael had disbanded the militia, who
guarded the passes of Mount Olympus, and had thus
left Bithynia open to attack. Orchan, the son of Othman,
took advantage of these favourable occurrences,
enlarged his territory at the expense of the Greeks,
and by uniting several of the scattered Turkish tribes
under one head, laid the foundation of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>Thus the circumstances of the times were throughout
eminently favourable to the Ottomans. The fall
of the Seljouk monarchy, and the consequent diffusion
of the Turkish population, had given free scope to
their enterprising spirit. Through the civil wars of
the Byzantine Emperors and the disputes of the Venetians
and Genoese, they were enabled to gain their
first footing in Europe. Had Amurath&#8217;s attempt to
extend his kingdom over the Christian nations of
Thrace and Roumelia been made in the 11th century,
he would have roused all Europe in common resistance
to his rising power. But in 1388, the Servian confederacy
could obtain no aid from Western Christendom.
As long as Richard II. was king of England,
and Charles VI. of France&mdash;while Germany was ruled
by the dissolute Winceslaus&mdash;Amurath had little to
fear from the powers of the West<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>. Spain was too
much occupied by her wars with the Moslems at home
to think of the sufferings of her Christian brethren in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the East. Nor was there any danger that the rival
popes of Avignon and Rome would forget their private
animosities to assist in arresting the fall of a distant
and schismatical church.</p>

<p>At the crowning point of their success, the siege of
Constantinople by Mahomet II., the advantages of
time were again on the side of the Ottomans. The
Roman pontiff, furious at their obstinacy in refusing
to join the communion of the Latin church, had conceived
an aversion for the Greeks which could hardly
be exceeded by any abhorrence of the Mnssulman&#8217;s
creed. It might have been expected that he would
rouse himself to prevent the destruction of the Eastern
defences of Christendom, but he chose rather a selfish
and inglorious part, content to foresee and even to
foretell the coming overthrow of the Greek Empire<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.
Thus did the Patriarch of the West, the natural head
of any confederacy for the succour of Constantinople,
look on at its fall with seeming unconcern. Meanwhile
the English and the French were engaged in a
quarrel too deadly to be reconciled. The Germans
would not join with the Hungarians, nor would the
Spanish have any concert with the Genoese. In short
no coalition of the powers of Europe was possible.
Even the Greeks themselves were too much divided
by religious dissensions to offer united resistance to
their Moslem foe, and their want of union could only
be equalled by their cowardice. The valour of the
last Constantine did indeed shed glory over his own
particular fate, but the issue of the struggle could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
be doubtful when the disciplined troops and the famed
artillery of the Turk were opposed to the feeble and
disunited force of the enervated Byzantines.</p>

<p>These external circumstances are important, as having
been auxiliary to the rise of the Ottomans. But
the main causes of their success must be sought in the
wisdom of their rulers and in the institutions which
they established.</p>

<p>Their government was most singularly constituted,
and of a character totally dissimilar to any of the
governments of Christendom. The institutions too
from which they derived their solid and lasting power
were for the most part peculiar to themselves. On
these institutions the stability of the Ottoman greatness
mainly rested. With their first appearance it
arose; with their gradual development it had grown;
as they were neglected and fell into disuse, the ancient
glory of the Crescent was dimmed, obscured, and
finally extinguished.</p>

<p>Even in the legendary history of the founder of
their nation is shadowed forth the faint outline of their
peculiar, policy. By patient waiting till he attained
his purpose, Othman won his wife from an alien
tribe. His expeditions were sanctioned by the blessing
of the Holy Scheik Edebali. From the fruit of these
expeditions, from the Christian captives who were
condemned to slavery, was selected the wife of his son
Orchan. A Christian apostate, &#8216;Michael of the Pointed
Beard&#8217; was the chief of Othman&#8217;s captains.</p>

<p>It was from the example of their founder, they would
have us believe, that they adopted customs of receiving
renegades, of foreign intermarriage, a warlike zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
sanctioned by religion, a system of slavery-institutions
which in later times were the distinguishing
characteristics of their race<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>. It matters not if these
accounts of Othman&#8217;s early history be the invention of
later times; this rather shows (since fiction is more
philosophical than truth), that the Ottomans themselves
were convinced that it was mainly on the preservation
of these usages that their greatness rested.
It was, however, reserved for the sons of Othman to
set the system on a permanent basis, and to the legislative
genius of Alaeddin in the succeeding reign, was
chiefly due the stability of the Ottoman race.</p>

<p>In general the Asiatic dynasties culminate to their
height of power with a marvellous rapidity, and then,
dependent solely on the merits of their rulers, with no
institutions calculated to ensure any lasting greatness,
fall by a decline no less rapid and less marvellous than
their rise. The career of Ottoman conquest lacked
the dazzling grandeur which invests the exploits of
Genghis Khan, or Timour, but it was not destined to
be as ephemeral as they. In its slow and cautious
advance, in the gradual organization of conquered
provinces, in the unswerving patience which waited
always for the fittest opportunity, it bore no faint resemblance
to the stately march of Roman sovereignty.</p>

<p>The close of Othman&#8217;s life of seventy years saw him
but just made possessor of a single city of importance.
It was not till the reign of Orchan that the Ottomans
ceased to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Iconian
Sultans, and first adopted a coinage of their own. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
wise policy of Orchan&#8217;s coadjutor, Alaeddin, gave them
a respite from war for twenty years, in which time he
consolidated the small kingdom they had already won,
and perfected a system which was to be the instrument
of future conquest.</p>

<p>It was during this period of tranquillity that the
organization of the army was effected&mdash;an organization
which, possessing in itself the various merits of the
most invincible forces that have ever been collected&mdash;the
asceticism and brotherhood of the Spartan companies,
the mixture of races in the army of Hannibal, the
religious zeal of the English Puritans, and the devotion
of Caesar&#8217;s 10th legion&mdash;added to all these, two peculiarities
of their creed, the absolute subjection of every
individual to the sacred authority of the Sultan, and
the warlike inspirations of a religion that taught them
that &#8216;in the conflict of the crossing scymetars Paradise
was to be won.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is a remarkable and significant fact, that this
abstinence from war for the long period of twenty
years was never repeated by the Ottomans during the
time of their success. That soldiers long unemployed
must become either citizens or rebels is an axiom which
must have special force in a government like that of
the Ottomans. War was the normal condition of their
race. It was to this object that not only their iconoclastic
creed, but the whole tenor of their institutions
pointed, and in this aspect they must chiefly be contemplated.</p>

<p>The feudal system of the Ottomans was essentially
military. It was the device of an aggressive power
and was made to answer a double purpose; to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the permanency of its conquests, and to supply soldiers
for war. Ottoman feudalism was wholly different
from that which prevailed in Western Europe. The
great distinction lay in the fact, that among the Ottomans
all the feudal vassals held their fiefs directly of
the Sultan, or his officers; whereas in Western Europe,
between the sovereigns and the lower tenants was interposed
a powerful class, which always more or less
counterbalanced the supreme power. The one was
the division of a kingdom into petty fiefs, the other
the fusion of conquered territories under the sway of
one victorious monarch. It was through the feudal
system of the Ottomans, in combination with their
institution of slavery, that war was made to feed war;
that every conquest supplied the means for future
conquest.</p>

<p>The use of the Ottoman system for the supply of
soldiers in time of war may be estimated from the fact,
that an armed horseman was required for every fief of
the value of twelve pounds a year, and another for
every additional twenty pounds. In the time of Solyman
these fiefs were able to furnish 150,000 cavalry<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.
The feudal troops were always kept in readiness, nor
was anything required to summon them to the field
but an order of the Sultan to the two Beglerbegs of
the Empire from whom it was communicated to a
regular gradation of officers entrusted with the task of
mustering these Spahi, or Cavaliers, in their separate
divisions<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>. This force served without pay. If they
fell in battle, they were honoured as martyrs: if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
distinguished themselves, or if the expedition was successful,
they were rewarded with larger gifts of property.
All their hopes of advancement depended upon
the Sultan, and his success in war. They were ready
to do his bidding in any part of the world, for the
greater part of every country which they subdued was
divided among the members of their own body.</p>

<p>It is to this institution of feudalism that we must
look for an explanation of the fact, that the Turkish
conquests, unlike those of other great conquerors,
seldom returned to their original possessors. Immediately
an additional piece of territory was gained, it
became an integral part of the Empire. Thus it was
that the Sultans were able to consolidate and unite
their dominions, step by step, with every fresh acquisition
of land. In most cases, the conquest of distant
territories has been any thing rather than lucrative to
the victorious nation. But the Turkish conquests reimbursed
the Sultan, and enriched the nation; some
portions of land were regularly assigned to the sovereign,
and others became public property.</p>

<p>Thus the community of the Timarli, or fief-holders,
carried out, on a large scale, the intention of the Roman
system of colonise, both as guarding the dangerous
frontiers and ensuring the preservation of conquered
lands.</p>

<p>But there is one aspect of the Ottoman feudalism
which we have not yet regarded, and which redounds
more than any other to their honor. Toleration of
creed, with one remarkable exception, was given to
the conquered Christians, and even in the days of
Othman, equal protection was dealt out alike to Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and Turk, Christian and Mahometan. This tolerant
and enlightened system induced numbers of the Christians
who dwelt on the borders of the Ottoman Empire
to exchange their hard position, as Hungarian
serfs, for that of Rayas under the Turks.</p>

<p>We have said that there was one most signal exception
to the general toleration of their rule, and this was
the institution of the corps of Janissaries, the Yengi
Cheri, or &#8220;New Soldiers&#8221; of Alaeddin. The importance
of a well-disciplined standing army struck the
far-seeing mind of Orchan&#8217;s coadjutor, and to the
organization of the army he gave his chief attention
during the twenty years of peace of which we have
spoken. He first formed, of the native Osmanli, a
corps of paid infantry. But it soon appeared that
these Turks were too proud and turbulent to endure
the necessary discipline. In this perplexity we are
told that Alaeddin sought the advice of his relative
Black Khalil Tschendereli. Black Khalil&#8217;s counsel
dictated a device of the most subtle and effective kind&mdash;that
the Ottoman army must be formed out of the
children of the conquered Christians, who should be
forced to become Mahometans. By this means, he
argued, you will gain troops which can be schooled to
any discipline. To the Mussulman religion you will
gain many converts, while you will prevent any rebellion
of your Christian subjects by the incorporation
of the whole strength of their race with your own
forces. The plan was adopted by Alaeddin and carried
out in the next reign by the First Amurath.
Amurath&#8217;s warlike spirit, and the lust of conquest
that was predominant in his race, led him to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
repeated expeditions against the Sclavonic tribes of
Servia and Bosnia. Among this hardy race he found
no treasures of gold and silver&mdash;no spoil for his conquering
army&mdash;but he found an inexhaustible supply
of brave soldiers<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>. The children who were taken
captive in his wars were immediately disciplined in
the schools of the Janissaries, and in due time drafted
into their ranks. Those who were not available for
this purpose, or for the service of the Sultan, were
sold as slaves, and thus brought in a considerable
revenue to the Turkish Emperor.</p>

<p>As long as the flower of the Christian youth were
converted not merely into Mahometans, but into devoted
supporters of the Ottoman power, any revolt of
the Rayas was impossible. In their strict discipline
and continued occupation the proselytes lost all remembrance
of their kindred and their country. With
the highest positions in the Empire open to their ambition,
they might well glory in a station that raised
them over the heads of the native Osmanli. The
rigorous pride with which they kept their own body
aloof from any foreign admixture may offer a parallel
to that remarkable system by which the proudest
chivalry of Egypt was formed out of Circassian
slaves.</p>

<p>Thus at the court of the Sultan were gathered an
abundance of men, from various nations, devoted only
to the common weal of the race into which they were
adopted. Not only were there the prisoners taken in
war, as well as the tithe, so to speak, of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
children taken every five years, but from every pacha
of the Empire came presents of slaves to the Sultan<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.
These slaves were divided into different classes, according
to their abilities. Those who were destined for
Janissaries were trained to every exercise that could
increase their physical strength, and inure them to toil
and hardship. Others were educated for the more
immediate service of the Sultan, either as his state-officers
or his body-guard. Thus the Turkish armies,
though they were those of an Asiatic nation, were
composed of the hardiest of Europeans. Nor were
these Europeans ever suffered to fall into the enervating
habits of Asiatics. They had no homes in which
they could be pampered with Oriental luxury. Their
barracks were like monasteries; their dress the dark
robes of monks; their meals the frugal fare of mountaineers.
They were not allowed to take wives; they
might ply no trades; engage in no commerce; nor
were any admitted into their body who had not gone
through the regular course of this discipline. At home
they lived as if they were in the camp; in the camp
they preserved the same order, the same discipline as
at home. War was the occupation of their life. They
had given no &#8220;hostages to fortune;&#8221; they had no
domestic ties that could bind them to a peaceful life.
Their hopes of advancement rested on their valour in
battle. They were justly proud of the achievements
of their corps, and were stimulated by every motive
of ambition, self-interest, and the love of glory, above
all, emulation to surpass the successes of their predecessors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
They knew that the watchful eyes of the
Sultan were on them in the fight, and that every deed
of heroism would meet with its appropriate reward.
If he fell, what recked a Janissary of death, save as the
glorious consummation of his prowess, as the opening
of Paradise to the martyr who had won it<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>?</p>

<p>The testimony of contemporary writers to the wonderful
efficacy of this remarkable institution is unanimous.
Schwendi, a general of their opponents, owns
that the Janissaries had never turned their backs in
battle. Busbequius, the German ambassador, struck
with admiration at their discipline and endurance,
warns his countrymen of the nature of the foe whom
they must be prepared to encounter, if they enter a
war with the Turks. Barbaro, an ambassador of the
Venetian government, comments with wonder on the
fact that the power of the Ottomans mainly rested on
a corps of compulsory converts from Christianity.
The Venetian Relationi, quoted by Von Ranke, are
full of the remarks of ambassadors expressing their
admiration of the whole system of the Ottoman arms<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous features of their discipline
was the order, temperance, and cleanliness of an
Ottoman camp, as constrasted with the drunken, dissolute,
and filthy habits of the armies of Christendom<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.
Frequently encamped as they were in the pestilential
districts which proved disastrous to the French and
English armies at the commencement of the late Russian
war, we can easily understand how great an advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>tage
over their opponents these wise regulations secured
them in their campaigns.</p>

<p>The fiery valour of the Christian knights might
surpass the more patient courage of the Ottoman
troops, but their pride of birth, and spirit of independence
would not brook the discipline, nor render the
obedience, for which the Janissaries were remarkable;
and to this may be attributed the fatal results of the
battle of Nicopolis. At Kossova the Asiatic wing of
the Turkish army had recoiled from the repeated onsets
of the Bosnian king and his warriors, but the Janissaries
&#8216;fighting with the zeal of proselytes&#8217; against their
Sclavonic brethren recovered the fortunes of the day
for Amurath<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>. At Varna the panic which had spread
through the Turkish troops from the furious attacks of
Ladislaus and Hunyades was only checked by the firm
resistance, the unflinching endurance of the Janissaries<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.
When the desperate and heroic resistance of the last
Greek Emperor, and his few brave adherents, had
driven back the Anatolian soldiery, and the fate of
Constantinople was still hanging in the balance, it was
their surpassing valour that turned the scales of victory,
bore down all resistance, and won Eastern Rome for
the capital of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>At the great crises of their history we have seen how
it was the power of the Janissaries that saved the Ottomans;
but in every battle, in every campaign, the
possession of a formidable corps of well-disciplined
infantry at a time when their opponents had no regular
infantry at all, gave them a continual advantage. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
has been remarked that the Ottomans never encountered
the forces of the only two European nations who
had at this time any organized foot-soldiers<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. We all
know how the chivalry of France fell before the English
bowmen at Cressy and Poictiers, and how the
troops of Austria fled before the halberdiers of Switzerland,
and we may doubt whether the Janissaries would
have been equally invincible had they met the English
or the Swiss on the battle-fields of Servia.</p>

<p>The institution of the Janissary force must not be
considered as a system of mere cruelty and intolerance.
The records of the age tell us that it was an usual
occurrence for Christian parents voluntarily to bring
their sons to the press-gang of the Janissaries, in order
that in due time they might be enrolled in their ranks,
while the high offices which were thrown open to these
proselytes of Mahometanism brought renegades in
numbers to the Sultan&#8217;s court, where no distinction of
birth or country interfered to mar their fortunes. This
system of the reception of refugees from all countries
gained for the Ottomans many of the greatest names
which adorn their history. Of the ten grand-viziers of
Solyman, eight were renegades from Christianity. It
was indeed noted as an unusual circumstance that one
of his viziers was a native Turk<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>. Piale, who defeated
the united Christian fleets in 1560 off the isle of Djerbe,
was himself the son of Christian parents. Cicala
Pasha, the great commander under the successors of
Solyman, was an Italian by birth, but as aga of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Janissaries became one of the fiercest enemies of the
Christians. And in the earliest times we find that
Evrenos, who under Bajazet and Amurath I. added
the greater part of Greece to the Ottoman dominions,
was originally a Christian chieftain and a guardian of
the passes of Mount Olympus. During the flourishing
period of the Empire nearly all the high civil and
military offices were filled by Christian slaves, who had
risen either from the ranks of the Janissaries, or who
had been brought up by the Mufti in the profession of
the law<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>. Thus, to use the words of Gibbon, &#8220;a servile
class, an artificial people, were raised by the discipline
of education to obey, to conquer, and to command<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it be true according to the account we have given
of the constitution of the Empire, that the highest
offices of the state were conferred by the ruling prince
on men raised by his own hand from slavery&mdash;that the
feudal tenants were subject to a single superior, and
the army directed by a single will,&mdash;it is evident that
nothing but the largest capacity for legislation and
military command could have successfully wielded
such enormous authority.</p>

<p>Of the extraordinary genius of the early Sultans
there is abundant proof<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. The character of Othman
was precisely suited for one who was to be the
founder of a dynasty. He was conspicuous among a
warlike tribe for his boldness and independence, and
he possessed that marvellous influence over the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of those around him, which is one of the peculiar
characteristics of the greatest men. In Orchan we see
the enduring watchfulness, the indomitable resolution
which never fails to attain its object, while in the person
of Alaeddin his coadjutor we may admire the far-sighted
legislator, the brightness of whose original
genius shone forth undimmed by the prejudices of an
unenlightened age. By the organization of a standing
army he marked out future conquests for his race,
while by the tolerant spirit of his legislation he ordained
that a due protection should be given to the conquered.
Amurath by a series of successful campaigns
gained the city of Adrianople for his capital. Then
with admirable prudence he paused for a while to consolidate
his conquests and mature his resources, and
thus paved the way for his final victory at Kossova.
The name of Yilderim or the Thunderbolt testifies to
the energy of the First Bajazet, but it was a just punishment
for his overbearing pride in later years that
the Tartar Conqueror Timour was provoked to crush
his power on the field of Angora, and to doom him to
an ignominious captivity. The work of the destroyer
was for the time complete, and it seemed as if the
Ottoman power was irrecoverably ruined. But the
mould into which their national life had been cast was
not so easily destroyed. The force of their institutions
still remained, and the people were still attached to the
tolerance of their ancient government, and so, after
many years of civil war, the unity of the Ottoman
power was easily restored by the vigorous hand of
Mahomet the First. The bold measures of Amurath
II. caused the signal overthrow of his Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
opponents at Varna, and the annexation of Servia and
Bosnia in the succeeding reign are due in great
measure to his toleration and prudence. The abdication
of his father gave Mahomet the Second experience
in the command of an Empire at the early
age of eighteen, and a double failure as viceroy secured
him wisdom for his sole reign. Setting aside
any consideration of his character, it is impossible to
deny his legislative ability and military genius, in
building up the greatness of his nation. The domestic
dissensions of the Empire, under the feebler hand of
Bajazet II., showed how requisite a warlike and energetic
Sultan was to its preservation under its peculiar
constitution. Tabriz, and the subjection of the Mamelukes,
were monuments of the ferocious spirit of the
warrior Selim. By ceaseless carnage he made himself
master of the whole of Egypt, took great part of
Syria, and added the Caliphate to the titles of the
Ottoman sovereign. At the moment when his cruelty
had nearly driven his people to rebellion, the rise of
Solyman furnished a pillar of strength to the house of
Othman. At the time of his reign the thrones of
Europe, as well as those of Persia and India, were
occupied by some of the most powerful sovereigns of
modern times. But in &#8220;a century rich with mighty
spirits&#8221; there are few names which can compare with
that of Solyman the Magnificent, the great lawgiver
and commander of his nation. Under his sway, the
dynasty of the Ottoman Turks reached its zenith.
Though the institutions of his predecessors, and the
military organization they had bequeathed, supplied
a foundation, yet it was in great measure to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
genius, vigour, and capacity, that the mighty fabric of
the Ottoman power owed its stupendous greatness,
and that an Empire founded but three centuries before
by a few families of wandering Turkomans, then
numbered among its subjects twenty different races,
and nearly fifty millions of inhabitants, and still survives
with wonderful tenacity, after three centuries of
decline, unbroken by a single vicissitude of success.</p>

<p>Thus for ten successive reigns, with perhaps a single
exception, the throne of the Ottoman Turks was held
by men of extraordinary talents. Nor was this vigour
of the early Sultans merely accidental. The strict
discipline to which they were subjected in early years,
the attention that was paid to their education, and
their subsequent training in the council and the field,
must all have tended to this result.</p>

<p>The real weakness of the Ottoman government, its
absolute dependence on a single man, was marvellously
compensated and overcome by a continued succession
of vigorous sovereigns. The superiority of a well
regulated constitution over a despotism generally lies
in a comparative equality of ability through all its
different members. As long as absolute power is held
by the strong hand of a great man all is prosperous.
But a continued succession of great men rarely occurs,
and when it falls to an irresolute hand to wield the
sceptre of despotism the real weakness of the system
appears. In France, the Revolution was the ultimate
result of the exercise of unlimited power, by Louis the
fourteenth; in England, the great Rebellion was the
final issue of the attempt to subject the English people
to a despotism. The reason that the same result did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
not occur in the case of the Ottomans is to be found
in the historic facts: first, that the later Sultans were,
in the eyes of Mahometans, the successors of the Prophet,
as well as the descendants of Othman; and,
secondly, that the Janissaries, like the Praetorian
guards at Rome, jealously prevented their rulers from
being made subject to any power but their own.</p>

<p>Besides the wonderful efficacy of their military organization
and the talents of their Sultans, there is one
point of their history which is worthy of remark as
having tended indirectly towards their success. The
whole tenor of their legislation was much in advance
of that of the European powers in general. English
history has often been said to be a century before that
of France, but the history of the early Turkish Emperors
was much more strikingly advanced beyond
that of the other sovereigns of Europe. At the end of
the fifteenth century, when, although the times were
not yet ready for the development of popular right, the
oppressions of European feudalism had become intolerable,
the strong hand of despotic sovereigns supplied
the only safe guard against lawless outrage. The
aggrandizement of their power at that time saved the
states which they governed. In this respect, however,
the Ottomans were before their age&mdash;for whilst the states
of Europe were for the most part impotent through
the overbearing spirit of the feudal nobility, the Ottoman
government was vigorously swayed by an Absolute
Monarch<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>. Thus, when England was distracted
by the wars of the Roses, Mahomet the Conqueror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
was leading his nation on to victory. In fact, the
aggrandizement of the Ottoman Sultans was anterior
to that of the European sovereigns.</p>

<p>In other points we may notice the same advancement
in their history. Their whole military system
was beyond their age. They possessed disciplined
infantry, when a standing army was unknown, and
cavalry had not yet been supplanted by foot-soldiers
in the rest of Europe. They had a regular commissariat
department to supply their armies with the necessaries
of war, and a special corps to do the work of
Sappers and Miners, long before such a division of
labour was adopted by Christendom. On the departments
of artillery and engineering Mahomet II.
bestowed his special attention. The Ottomans first
made regular approaches in besieging a fortress, and
became masters of the Italians in the art of fortification<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.</p>

<p>It is curious also that a nation popularly considered
to have consisted of unenlightened barbarians should
have been far in advance of us in some of the points
which we consider as the distinguishing features of
modern European civilization. Every advantage of
Free Trade was allowed to the foreign merchant who
traded to the Turkish sea-ports<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>. A system of municipal
government was established throughout their
dominions. A religious toleration beyond the spirit of
the age was carried out towards the Christian population
of their kingdom. In this particular the difference
in the spirit of the Christian and Turkish governments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
is well illustrated by a traditionary account of the
answers of Amurath and Hunyades, when questioned
by the Servians on the subject of the maintenance of
their religion. While Hunyades is said to have
declared that, if victorious, he would compel them to
join the Latin Communion, Amurath&#8217;s famous answer
was: &#8220;I will build a church near every mosque, and
the people shall worship in whichever they may
prefer<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not to a purer moral principle that the
system owed its origin. The clear sight of their rulers
perceived that some toleration was necessary for the
well-being of their composite empire. But the ruling
genius of their creed was not tolerant then, any more
than it is now. The institution of the Janissaries was
in accordance with the tenets of their religion. But
the protection of their Christian subjects was the conciliatory
measure of a wise legislator, not of a devout
Mahometan. Oh the one hand the compulsory conversion
of a large portion of their hardier slave-population
furnished them with a rich harvest of soldiers,
while their toleration in other respects procured for
them the contentment of their less warlike subjects.</p>

<p>The truth of the remark of Machiavelli that a man
cannot found a state without opportunities, was not
impugned by the rise of Othman and his dynasty.
The divisions of the Seljukians seemed to invite the
exaltation of some new power. A widely diffused
Turkish population was left without a ruler. The
imbecility of the Persian and Eastern Empires afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
ample scope for purposes of aggression. The distracted
state of Christendom prevented any combination
against the intrusion of Mussulmans in Europe.</p>

<p>Such were the external circumstances that favoured
the rise of the Ottomans. But the great internal
Causes of their successes we have traced to the genius of
their early Sultans, and to their military organization,
under which latter head must be included their peculiar
feudal system and the institution of their Janissary
corps. There were other incidental causes of their
greatness, such as the warlike spirit common to the
Tartar race and the Mahometan religion, the absolute
position of the supreme head which gave unity to
the empire, and its early progress in prudent legislation.</p>

<p>The failure of the two great elements of their power
mainly caused their decline. The empire needed
vigorous rulers; the Sultans after Solyman have been
characterized by a native statesman as &#8220;either fools or
tyrants.&#8221; It required a well-disciplined army; but
after Solyman, the discipline of the Janissaries decayed;
their very system was corrupted; they admitted native
Turks into their body; they began to take wives and
to ply trades, becoming turbulent citizens rather than
soldiers; and with their decay fell the military organization
of the state.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
